<p>P: &#8220;You only care about yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;I identify as being the whole of nature. Therefore, there is nothing I am excluding by only caring about myself because that is the same thing as caring about everything simultaneously.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>I would like to formally redact the racist, sexist, classist, ablist, ethnocentric, and otherwise bigoted, derogatory, factually incomplete, escapist, scapegoating, and animosity-filled comments I published on any of my websites or on the w\World Wide Web in general.</p>
<p>To those who condemn me for appearing to only care about making myself feel better rather than making those I may have hurt feel better as my motivation for writing and publishing this note, I will not argue to the contrary. Yes, I am unabashedly self-serving and always prioritize making myself feel satisfied over making other people feel satisfied.</p>
<p>What I want to do for now on is stop (or at least minimize) making racist, sexist, classist, ablist, ethnocentric, and otherwise bigoted, derogatory, factually incomplete, escapist, scapegoating, and animosity-filled comments because making those comments makes me feel sad and unkind. I want to be a kind person. I want to help increase the kindness in the world rather than reduce it. I see all persons as part of one big family and I feel pain at the thought of anyone feeling deprived of respect, compassion, and a decent standard of living. Knowing that other people are hurting does not make me feel good. I do not derive satisfaction from other people being tortured or harmed in any way.</p>
<p>Of course, I want to promote people being tough, resilient, self-governing, healthy, addicted to life-long personal growth (i.e. education, art, athletics, business, spirituality, et cetera which one finds intrinsic motivation and satisfaction pursuing). As a result of my own personal experience, I conclude that it is better to error on the side of &#8220;under praising&#8221; people than &#8220;over praising&#8221; them so that people learn how to motivate themselves and set and achieve their own goals. The more people do that, the better I think they will be able to coexist in harmony and be able to collaborate in healthy ways (rather than compete with each other in ways which involves having to sabotage one&#8217;s competition in order to &#8220;get ahead&#8221;).</p>
<p>If every person is unique, then every person has a unique perspective, knowledge, and &#8220;job&#8221;. Hence, people would not have to compete with each other for a particular role because each person inevitably has its own unique niche to fill. (As cliche as this may sound, what I am trying to promote in my websites is a shift from &#8220;scarcity&#8221; mindset to &#8220;abundance&#8221; mindset).</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and to gain a better understanding of what I am trying to promote. No matter who you are, I want you to have a life of abundance, happiness, well-being, and freedom. I would even daresay I love you unconditionally from God&#8217;s non-dualistic and omniscient perspective with at least as much intimacy, compassion, non-judgmentalness, and curiosity (however morbid) as you and I locally (i.e. from each of our our tinier dualistic perpectives) have access to. (My definition of God is panpsychic and pantheist (which means that I think that God is ubiquitous, synonymous with nature, and that all phenomena are contained within one mind; that consciousness is the most fundamental substrate of reality. I even think all imaginable phenomena exist and are included immutably as fragments of God&#8217;s mind (i.e. the all-encompassing mind which is God and which imagines all parts of reality unconditionally))).</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
