<p>A: &#8220;Too much freedom prevents an information processing agent from being able to make a decision because that information processing agent would have infinite options to consider and, hence, not be able to finish analyzing each of them before using an algorithmic process of elimination to incrementally disregard the worst options until exactly one option (i.e. the best option) is selected as the inevitable outcome to that information processing agent&#8217;s decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>A: &#8220;Likewise, too little freedom prevents an information processing agent from being able to make a decision because there would be zero options at minimum and one option at maximum. Having zero options means that the information processing agent would have nothing to do but observe the elapsing of time. Having exactly one option means that the information processing agent would be forced to execute the only option it knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>B: &#8220;What would be the optimum number of options for an information processing agent to have?&#8221;</p>
<p>A: &#8220;That depends on the type of information processing agent. The more complex of information an information processing agent can process and render, the more options that information processing agent would need in order to optimize its intelligence. Any less than some maximum natural number of options would make the information processing agent feel too limited. I would say that the minimum number of options an information processing agent should have in order for that information processing agent to have agency (i.e. decision-making power) and to not just be an object is two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Earlier today I got an email from Amazon asking for more information about some crimes which were listed on my background check report. Below is the text from the email from Amazon followed by my reply (not including the image which was attached to that email reply of a paper I got from the court house showing the details of a past court date). Today I also got a phone call from the Smart &amp; Final store in Pleasanton (which is close to the Dublin BART station) offering me a merchandise handling job and the notice that I would later be receiving an email inviting me to accept or decline the offer. I accepted the offer and have a urine drug test scheduled for Wednesday in Fremont. I am going to try to get the urine drug test in Pleasanton tomorrow before noon even though there was no schedule spaces available to do so. (I was told today by the receptionist at the Pleasanton Quest Diagnostics that employment related drug tests were only performed in the morning hours and that I would probably have to make an appointment in order to ensure that I would get to complete the test when I come in).</p>

<p>&#8211; Location: ALAMEDA COUNTY, CA / Case Number: 21-CR-007690 / Offense Description: Petty Theft / Filing date: 06/30/2021</p>
<p>While in a Safeway near West Dublin/Pleasanton BART station, I stole approximately $30 worth of groceries by putting them in a plastic bag I was carrying with me while I walked into the store. After I put the food items in the bag, I walked out the door of the store without going through the checkout. Store employees saw me walk out without paying for the merchandise and called the police. The police quickly found me walking away from the store and, about a block later, they detained me and put me in Santa Rita County Jail for a day.</p>
